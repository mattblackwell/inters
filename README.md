# inters

`inters` is an R package with tools to estimate interactions. Currently, it implements the post-double-selection approach to estimating interactions described in this [working paper by Matthew Blackwell and Michael Olson][lasso-paper]. To install the development version of `inters`, run the following code in R:
```R
require(devtools)
install_github("mattblackwell/inters", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
